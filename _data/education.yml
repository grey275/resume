    Lighthouse Labs is a fantastic coding bootcamp that improved my programming skills tremendously, introduced me to cornerstone web technologies, and gave me experience working with others in a fast-paced environment. Importantly, I also found that I still greatly enjoyed software development after spending an inordinate amount of time immersed in it.

        Programming started out as an occasional hobby that I enjoyed, but over time has consumed more and more of my attention with
    new projects, curiosities, and ideas. The volume of resources dedicated to programming online has made my time spent online unexpectedly productive,
    though of course there are always areas where I should probably spend more time(and some where I should spend less).

    __General Skills Developed__:
      * Computational Problem Solving
      * Independent Troubleshooting and Debugging
      * How to use the Internet to learn things quickly
      * How to ask questions people want to answer

    __Technical Skills Developed__:
      * Data-Structures and Algorithms
      * Object Oriented Programming
      * Functional Programming
      * Linux Shell Scripting
      * Linux Command Line Utilities and General System Architecture
      * Machine Learning and Computer Vision basics
