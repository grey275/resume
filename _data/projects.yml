    Open source is Fun!
  description: |
    I've made a few small contributions to Microsoft's [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), a popular open-source text editor. The process of submitting and iterating on pull requests improved my understanding of how to ask for feedback on desired behaviour, code quality, as well as how to effectively propose code changes, among other things. Also, perhaps most importantly, it really improved my process when it comes to grappling with a new codebase/feature.
